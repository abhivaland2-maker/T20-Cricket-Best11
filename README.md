# T20-Cricket-Best11
## Project Objective
To identify and analyze the best playing XI for T20 cricket based on performance metrics such as batting average, strike rate, bowling average, economy rate, and boundary percentage using Excel, Power BI, and DAX.

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a data-driven team selection model for T20 cricket. The dataset was prepared in Excel and integrated into Power BI for visualization and modeling. Using DAX, custom measures were created to evaluate player performance across different roles — Power Hitters, Anchors, Finishers, All-Rounders, and Specialist Fast Bowlers. The final dashboard allows users to select players interactively, compare KPIs, and form an optimized playing XI.
